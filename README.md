## Overview

The Smart City website is designed to enhance urban living by providing an efficient platform for users to request services, monitor water pollution,security issues,water usage,waste mangement and other city resources. This project includes user authentication, service request submission, administrative processing, and an IoT-based water  monitoring systems.
##The target is the residential and business cities being developed.e.g. Tatu city

1. **User Authentication**
   - Login and registration for users.
   -
2. **Service Request Submission**3
   - Users can browse and request various city services.
   - Service requests are submitted to the admin panel for processing.
**User Location identification**
#NB
when using the blue print idea the household name is given by each admin i.e to make sure that the nming convention is adhered to. hence the user is registered into the system by the admin when relocating to that place.
-A blue print of the city is created to aid in identifying houses location  to aid in direct response(Naming convention of hoouseholds keeps this idea into consideration for easier identification).
-Also geomapping services can be providing by minimizing the map to the entire city.This provides accurate coordinates for each house.
3. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Admin can view and manage service requests.
   - Allocation of requests to the relevant departments.
     

4. **Water Pollution Monitoring**
   - IoT-based system for real-time monitoring of water quality and also with integartion of geomapping the pollution area can be located and action taken.
   - Data visualization for pollution levels. 

5. **Water usage**
   - Introduction of IOT systems e.g smart meters to record the water used in each house hold

6. **power usage**
   - Introduction of IOT systems e.g smart meters to record the power used in each house hold and also detection of faults that occured in each household.
7. **Waste management **
   - Introduction of IOT systems e.g smart garbage collection containers to record garbage level in each container. and data sent for visualization and further processing .
6. **Security alert system**
   - Introduction of IOT systems i.e security alert system in case of any intrusion from suspicious people.
. **Set Up IoT Sensors**

  Each IOT system will be installed in each house hold.
## Usage of the system

1. **User Login/Registration**
   - Register a new account or log in with existing credentials.

2. **Submit Service Request**
   - After logging in, navigate to the Services page.
   - Click on a service, fill out the request form, and submit it.

3. **Admin Processing**
   - Admins can log in to the admin dashboard to view and manage service requests.
   - Allocate requests to relevant departments for processing.Concerned departments process the data and  action is taken

4. **Monitor various resources**
   - Accessing the data collectted by various IOT systems and displaying it on the dashboard to view real-time data from IoT sensors.
   - Data is visualized to show pollution levels and trends.
   -  Also from this panel the admin can take action to request for a solution to the concerned department to resolve any issue which has not been monitored and the department ensures that after the issue has been resolved through the system.
5. **Departments panels**
 - The issues are posted to the departments concerned and they are resolved form this point. After each issue has been resolved the department click on the resolved action and the admin can see directly form the admin panel that the issue has been resolved.
