# Smart City Website

## Overview

The Smart City website is designed to enhance urban living by providing an efficient platform for users to request services, monitor water pollution, and manage city resources. This project includes user authentication, service request submission, administrative processing, and an IoT-based water pollution monitoring system.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**
   - Login and registration for users.
   - Secure access using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

2. **Service Request Submission**
   - Users can browse and request various city services.
   - Service requests are submitted to the admin for processing.

3. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Admin can view and manage service requests.
   - Allocation of requests to the relevant departments.

4. **Water Pollution Monitoring**
   - IoT-based system for real-time monitoring of water quality.
   - Data visualization for pollution levels.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT
- **IoT:** MQTT (for sensor data communication)
- **Hosting:** AWS/Heroku
- **Additional Libraries:** Socket.IO (real-time communication), D3.js/Chart.js (data visualization)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB installed and running
- MQTT broker (like Mosquitto) installed for IoT communication

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-city-website.git
   cd smart-city-website
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=3000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/smartCityDB
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   MQTT_BROKER_URL=mqtt://localhost
   ```

4. **Run the Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Run the Frontend**

   Navigate to the `client` directory and run:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

6. **Set Up IoT Sensors**

   Ensure your IoT devices are configured to send data to the MQTT broker specified in the `.env` file.

## Usage

1. **User Login/Registration**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the login and registration page.
   - Register a new account or log in with existing credentials.

2. **Submit Service Request**
   - After logging in, navigate to the Services page.
   - Click on a service, fill out the request form, and submit it.

3. **Admin Processing**
   - Admins can log in to the admin dashboard to view and manage service requests.
   - Allocate requests to relevant departments for processing.

4. **Monitor Water Pollution**
   - Access the water pollution monitoring dashboard to view real-time data from IoT sensors.
   - Data is visualized to show pollution levels and trends.
