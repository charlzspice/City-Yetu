1. **User Authentication**
   - Login and registration for users.
   
2. **Service Request Submission**3
   - Users can browse and request various city services.
   - Service requests are submitted to the admin panel for processing.
**User Location identification**
-A blue print of the city is created to aid in identifying houses location  to aid in direct response
-Also geomapping services can be providing by minimizing the map to the entire city.This provides accurate coordinates for each house
3. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Admin can view and manage service requests.
   - Allocation of requests to the relevant departments.
     

4. **Water Pollution Monitoring**
   - IoT-based system for real-time monitoring of water quality and also with integartion of geomapping the pollution area can be located and action taken.
   - Data visualization for pollution levels. 

5. **Water usage**
   - Introduction of IOT systems e.g smart meters to record the water used in each house hold

6. **power usage**
   - Introduction of IOT systems e.g smart meters to record the power used in each house hold and also detection of faults that occured in each household.
7. **Waste management **
   - Introduction of IOT systems e.g smart garbage collection containers to record garbage level in each container. and data sent for visualization and further processing .
6. **Security alert system**
   - Introduction of IOT systems i.e security alert system in case of any intrusion from suspicious people.
. **Set Up IoT Sensors**

  Each IOT system will be installed in each house hold.
## Usage of the system

1. **User Login/Registration**
   - Register a new account or log in with existing credentials.

2. **Submit Service Request**
   - After logging in, navigate to the Services page.
   - Click on a service, fill out the request form, and submit it.

3. **Admin Processing**
   - Admins can log in to the admin dashboard to view and manage service requests.
   - Allocate requests to relevant departments for processing.Concerned departments process the data and  action is taken

4. **Monitor various resources**
   - Accessing the data collectted by various IOT systems and displaying it on the dashboard to view real-time data from IoT sensors.
   - Data is visualized to show pollution levels and trends.
   -  Also from this panel the admin can take action to resolve any issue which has not been monitored
